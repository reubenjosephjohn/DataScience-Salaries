# **Data Science Project: A Look into Salaries and Remote Work in the Data Science Field**

## Introduction

Monetary compensation and remote work have become key factors in job satisfaction. This project investigates the salaries and remote work trends in the data science field, providing insights for individuals entering this market. The goal is to help job seekers make informed decisions based on salary prospects and remote work opportunities.

## Guiding Question

**Do Data Engineers or Data Analysts have better salaries, and which role has more opportunities for remote work?**

## Dataset

This analysis uses the [Data Science Job Salaries dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) by Ruchi Bhatia (2022). The dataset includes variables such as:

- `salary_in_usd`: Salaries standardized to USD for global comparisons.
- `job_title`: Job titles in the data science field.
- `remote_ratio`: The proportion of remote work opportunities (0: <20%, 50: mixed, 100: >80%).

Other variables include experience level, company size, and location. However, the focus of this project is on job titles and remote work trends.

## Key Findings

- Comparison of salaries for Data Engineers vs. Data Analysts.
- Trends in remote work opportunities for these roles.

## Technologies Used

- **R**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **ggplot2**: For data visualization.
- **dplyr**: For data manipulation.
